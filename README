Warts and all, here's an example that allows XML-defined layout heirarchies   to be linked to XML-defined views.

You will need the latest RobotLegs / SwiftSuspenders (there was a recent XML injection fix)

The RobotLegs StateMachine classes

The core layout functionality is built upon Senocular's excellent classes, which are used here with a minor modification: rather than dispatching a generic Event.CHANGE, I changed it to specific LayoutEvent.SIZE_CHANGED and LayoutEvent.POSITION_CHANGED. I probably ought to be using his LayoutManager too, but I haven't figured it out yet.

I threw the sample graphics together. The three yellow stars are tied to three layout states. Click to transition.

* resizing the flash window updates the layout.
* clicking a button while a transition is in progress will queue it.
* resizing the flash window during transition is supported (and that's why everything is so complicated).

Additional documentation coming soon. Promise.
